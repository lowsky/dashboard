This project was used to figure out and to demonstrate, how to develop a frontend UI with Facebook's *Relay* and *GraphQL* libraries.

For deep interns of the concepts, see the link:https://lowsky.github.io/deck-graphql-relay-talk[presentation at the EnterJS Conference] with its link:https://www.github.com/lowsky/deck-graphql-relay-talk[slide sources]

== Purpose of this dashboard

This web app lists the (feature) branches of a specific github repository,

* shows the last commit's commit message
* shows the last commit's status
* (not implemented yet) links to running docker containers for each feature

On a meetup, this talk and presentation gave some details about the background idea: link:https://github.com/lowsky/dockerMeetupSlides[slides]

== Getting started locally
A reduced functionality with a RESTful api backend works out of the box.

For the Relay backend only, you might start this backend-server locally, see https://github.com/lowsky/github-rest-graphql-proxy/ (in its own terminal),

```
git clone https://github.com/lowsky/dashboard
cd dashboard
npm install  # or better just run  yarn  (if you have installed it already)
npm start &  # runs in background
open http://localhost:3000

# to update the page, you need to stop and re-start,
# or run webpack via
npm run prestart
# and refresh the page in the browser (this needs update!)
```

For local development you can use webpack-dev based hot-reloading per
```
npm run dev
# this opens the browser automatically
```

Then switch to either the REST based or the RELAY based view...

Have fun!
